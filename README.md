# Week 5 - Python Modules - Arcade

## Primitive Drawing
using arcade draw functions create the following
 - a yellow cartoon sun on a sky-blue background
 - a white Starbucks coffee cup with a green circle in the middle of it
 - a tic tac toe board (just the board) mint color background and white lines to draw the '#'

## Draw with functions

create a picture of a blue sky with a bunch of birds in it using functions
- create a function to create a bird, it should have two inputs (x, y) for the location of the bird. It should draw two black arcs connected at one end
- call the function times after you call the render function
